A spiritual person is someone who “examines all things” and who has “the mind of Christ.” A spiritual person is inclined toward God, they strive to “become imitators of God.” (Ephesian 5:1)  Jehovah God is real to them and they try to bring all their ways into harmony with His standards.  A spiritual person also endeavors to show “the fruitage of the spirit.” (Galatians 5:22,23) A person who keenly values spiritual or religious interests is called Spiritually-minded.
